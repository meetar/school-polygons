<p>Welcome to our <b>Targeted Editing</b> series where today you can try to decide which fruit cake is edible, or make <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> data incredible! (Both take about the same amount of time.)</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li><b>How can school polygons be used?</b>
          <p></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Help with map rendering!  Map rendering involves taking the raw data and turning it into a map.  A map label is great to have, but a polygon is even better.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Help with display order.  In many cases, the size of a school indicates significance.  When schools have polygons, the size of the school can be used to determine how much you should zoom in to the map before it appears.  Bigger schools can be shown sooner than smaller schools.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Help with search rank.  When searching, a search engine can use a number of things to prioritize what features are returned.  Some examples might be associated attributes like type, or even the physical size of a feature.  Since points have no area, adding a polygon could be an excellent enhancement.</li>
            </ol>

                <li>Check out this pie chart for schools in Atlanta:</li>
                <div id="schools_piechart" style="width: 100%; height: 500px;"></div>
                <p>We have some work to do!</p>
            </ul>

        <li><b>How you can help improve schools without polygons:</b>
            <p></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Here is a map styled by <a href="https://github.com/meetar">Peter Richardson</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/nvkelso">Nathaniel V. Kelso</a> showing schools that don&#39;t have polygons.  To add a polygon for a school that is only represented by a point, hover over one of the bright blue highlighted school points to bring up an info bubble with links to editing tools that can be used to add features!</li><p>

                  <ul>See the wiki pages for <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:amenity%3Dschool">amenity=school</a> for lots of details and a great example.  A polygon tagged amenity=school should cover the grounds of the school, <b>not just the building footprint.</b></ul>

                <p></p>
                (If you find a school that appears to have a polygon, but it's still highlighted, you may have found a duplicate or a building that was tagged amenity=school instead of the school grounds.  Improving those is a topic for another post...)
